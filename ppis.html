   <p> The Qatari nomination was an attempt by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup . With a population of two million, Qatar will be the first Arab country to host the World Cup. Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thani , son of Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani , Emir of Qatar at the time, was the head of the nomination committee. 
   </p>

      <p> Qatar promoted its hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab world , and had the support of all member states of the Arab League . They also positioned their attempt as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab world and the West.
        On November 17, 2010 , Qatar hosted a friendly match between Brazil and Argentina. This was one of the 47 international matches played across the world on this day.
     
      </p>
     
    <p>  FIFA President Joseph Blatter supported the idea of ​​holding the World Cup in the Arab world, saying in April 2010 : “The Arab world deserves to host the World Cup. They have 22 countries and they did not have any opportunity to organize the tournament.
        Blatter also praised Qatar's progress: “When I was in Qatar for the first time, there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organize the Asian Games with more than 30 men's events. And women, this is not in question.
         On 2 December 2010 , it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup .

    <p>  This is about 60 times the budget that South Africa spent on the 2010 World Cup . Nikola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investor summit in Munich that £ 107bn will be spent on stadiums and facilities, plus another £ 31bn on infrastructure and transport.
         Ritter said £ 30 billion will be spent on building air-conditioned stadiums with £ 48 billion worth of training and accommodation facilities for players and fans.
          28 billion will be spentAnother £100,000 to build a new city called Lusail that will surround the stadium that will host the opening and final matches of the tournament. 

    </p>
    <p> According to an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch ; The investment banking division of Bank of America , the organizers in Qatar asked FIFA to approve fewer stadiums due to the increased costs.
         Bloomberg LB said that Qatar would like to reduce the number of venues to 8 or 9 from the 12 originally planned.  A report issued on December 9, 2010 quoted FIFA President Joseph Blatter as saying that Qatar's neighbors could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no country was identified in the report. 
          Blatter added that any such decision must first be taken by Qatar and then approved by the FIFA Executive Committee.
         Prince statedAli bin Al-Hussein from Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding matches in Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and possibly Saudi Arabia will help to integrate the peoples of the region during the tournament.

        The first five proposed stadiums were revealed in early March 2010 . 
        The state intends for the stadiums to reflect the historical and cultural aspects of the State of Qatar  and for the designs to comply with the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility and sustainability. 
         The stadiums will be equipped with cooling systems intended to lower indoor temperatures by up to 20 °C (36 ° F ),  but it is not yet known if this will actually work in outdoor stadiums. Qatar aspires to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System for all World Cup stadiums. 
         All five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.

        Although, as of April 2017 , FIFA had not finalized the number of stadiums it should be ready for within five years, Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said it expected there to be eight stadiums in and near Doha (excluding Al Khor).
          In January 2019 , Gianni Infantino said that FIFA was studying the possibility of neighboring countries hosting matches during the tournament, in order to reduce political tensions. 
           Stadium 974 , formerly known as Ras Abu Aboud, is the seventh stadium for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, taking its name from the number of shipping containers used in its construction. The stadium will host seven matches during the tournament.

            Many media outlets have expressed concern about the suitability of Qatar to host the event,  with regard to interpretations of human rights , particularly conditions for workers and the rights of LGBTQ fans , [  due to the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.
              In December 2020 , Qatar allowed rainbow flags to be carried in the 2022 World Cup  Hassan Abdullah Al-Thawadi, CEO of Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup, said that Qatar will allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages during the event,  although Its consumption in public places is not permitted, Because the legal system in the country is based on Islamic law . 
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice of Qatar as the host country was controversial. 
            FIFA officials have been accused of corruption and allowing Qatar to buy the right to host the World Cup,  human rights groups have questioned the treatment of construction workers,  and criticized the high costs needed to make the plans a reality. 
             The climatic conditions prompted some to consider hosting the tournament in Qatar unfeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums clearing the way for a possible switch from summer to winter. In May 2014 , Joseph Blatter recalled, who was FIFA president at the time of selection but was later banned for illegal payments, until awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a mistake due to the intense heat.
              However, while addressing delegates from the African and Asian federations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including that of sponsors, were largely linked to racism and discrimination.

            Due to the prevailing climate in Qatar , concerns have been expressed about holding the World Cup in its traditional June - July time frame . In October 2013 , a task force was commissioned to look at alternative dates and report back after the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . 
             On 24 February 2015 , the FIFA Working Group proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022 ,  to avoid the summer heat between May and September and also to avoid conflicts with the 2022 Winter Olympics. and the 2022 Winter Paralympics in Beijing , China .
             The idea of ​​staging the tournament in November is controversial because it would overlap with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted that the clash with the Christmas season would likely cause disruption, while there were concerns about how short the tournament was. 
             FIFA Council member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the 2022 World Cup to a desert country is a blatant mistake.  Frank Lowe, chairman of Football Federation Australia , said that if the 2022 World Cup is moved to November and there is a disruption to the A- League schedule , we will seek compensation from FIFA.
            Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League , stated that they would consider legal action againstFIFA because this move would conflict with the program of the famous Christmas and New Year's matches in the English Premier League .  On March 19, 2015 , FIFA sources confirmed that the final match will take place on December 18, 2022 .

         <p><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Vote buying </font></b></p>
        <p> Qatar has faced increasing pressure over its hosting of the World Cup regarding the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam in securing the hosting.
              A former employee of the Qatar organization file team alleged that a number of African officials received US$1.5 million from Qatar,  however he retracted his claims, but later said that Qatari nominating officials forced him to do so.  In March 2014 , it was discovered that Jack Warner, former CONCACAF president, and his family had received nearly $2 million from a company linked to the successful Qatar campaign. 
             The FBI is investigating Jack Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari nomination.
        </p>
        <p> Five of FIFA's six main sponsors,  Sony , Adidas , Visa , Hyundai and Coca-Cola , have called on FIFA to investigate the allegations. 
             The Sunday Times published allegations of bribery based on the leak of millions of confidential documents.  FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce announced that he would support a re-vote to find a new host if allegations of corruption were proven.
               FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations, and the report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the allegations, the Qataris insist that the allegations of corruption are motivated by envy and mistrust while Joseph Blatter saidIt is fueled by racism in the British media. 

        </p>
        <p>In the 2015 FIFA corruption case , Swiss officials, acting under information from the US Department of Justice, arrested several senior FIFA officials in Zurich , Switzerland . They also confiscated physical and electronic records from FIFA's headquarters. Arrests continued in the United States , where several FIFA officials were arrested and FIFA premises raided. 
             The arrests were made based on information about a corruption and bribery scandal worth at least $150 million.  On June 7, 2015 , Phaedra Al-Majed, the former media official for the Qatar candidacy team, claimed that the allegations would lead to Qatar not hosting the World Cup.
             In an interview published the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that "if there is evidence that prizes awarded to Qatar and Russia were solely due to vote-buying, the awards can be annulled."

          <p>
            At the time of being awarded the right to host the tournament in 2010 , the Qatar national team was ranked 113th in the FIFA World Ranking ,  and had never qualified for a World Cup before.
             The furthest the team ever achieved in the Asian Cup finals was reaching the quarter-finals in 2000 .
              The most prestigious trophy the team achieved was the two-time Arabian Gulf Cup . Since gaining the right to host the tournament, they have won the Arabian Gulf Cup for the third time in 2014 and the 2019 Asian Cup .
               Qatar will be the smallest country to host the World Cup, as of 2010, had a population of less than a million people. These facts have led some to question the strength of Qatar's football culture and whether that makes it an unsuitable host for the World Cup.

          </p> 
          <p>
            The Qatar Football Association has also been known for naturalizing players from foreign countries for its team, examples of which are Sebastien Soria , Louise Martin Jr. and Emerson Sheikh .
              The QFA has previously attempted to provide incentives for unselected players from other countries to change their allegiance to Qatar.  Among them was the Brazilian trio of Ailton Gonçalves da Silva, Leonardo de Dios Santos and Leandro to help Qatar qualify for the 2006 World Cup .
               FIFA suspended the moves and, as a result, tightened the eligibility requirements for national teams.

         <p> Alcoholic beverages can be consumed legally in hotel bars and nightclubs by presenting a reporting passport and a special permit to attend clubs.  
            Hassan Abdullah Al-Thuwaid, CEO of Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup, said that when asked if alcohol was allowed in additional areas and in the matches themselves, he said that the Islamic State would also allow the consumption of alcohol during the World Cup.
             A few select fan zones will be set up during the event, which will offer alcoholic beverages for sale.
             Some bars are now being developed for all the tourists who are coming to support their World Cup teams.
